<h3>Created by: DataVu.us</h3>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Alef is an open-source JS Library, with a twist. Instead of using what can sometimes be confusing shortcodes, similar to 'jQuery'. Alef uses simple, easy to remember HTML Attributes. It really makes editing CSS, and JS much faster!</p>
<br><br><br>
<h2>Adding Code:</h2>
<h3> There are multiple ways to add code to an HTML file in Alef:</h3>
<p>1: You can link to an external '.alef' file like this:</p>
<p>alef.link("[Link to '.alef' file.]")</p>
<br>
<p>2: You can edit one directly:</p>
<p>alef.code("[Code seperated by ';', code must remain inline.]")</p>
<br>
<p>3: You can add Alef attributes directly to the HTML Element:</p>
<p>< p [Alef Attribute]="[command]"/></p>
